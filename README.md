# Vim's Code Collection

Good morning! I'm Vim. As of writing this I am a TA for multiple beginner Computer Science classes at the university that I attend. I am writing this in the hope that some people can learn from just having code put on a screen in front of them.

## Disclamer

I run Linux on my machine, which means that all of my testing has specifically been on Linux. I have made an attempt to make it possible to run all of these on Windows, however I am not particularly confident in my ability to write batch files. Please please please open an issue if you have any issues running this on Windows.

I would *highly* recommend downloading [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) if you can. Using that, you can run all of these programs as if you were using Linux from the command line.

## How to use

Each language has it's own folder, which is seperated into subfolders.
    Lessons:
        - An organized set of lessons that starts at the very beginning and slowly teaches more and more.
    Samples:
        - Sample bits of code that has been written. They don't nescicarily have an order, and are just there to be example code for specific topics.
    Assignments:
        - Assignments are projects that you can attempt if you wish to, or view my solution. They are meant as a challenge to see if you can apply what you've learned.

When you want to look at one project, each folder will have it's source files and a README.md in order to give more information.

I'm so sorry to anyone who knows how to make actual makefiles lmao.
