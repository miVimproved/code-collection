# Assignment 01: Printing Variables

In this assignment, you will be making sure you know how to print out variables.

## Topics

- The `main()` function.
- Printing variables.

## Description

Without changing the line I say to not change, make the code print the expected output.

Expected output:
```
I have 6 dogs.
I have 17 cookies.
I want 10.500000 dinosaurs!

```

There are multiple ways to do this. The way that I did it involves changing the variable at the top, adding two more variables, and then adding two more `printf` statements.


## How to test

- Linux:
  - Type "make" into the console.
- Windows:
  - TODO
