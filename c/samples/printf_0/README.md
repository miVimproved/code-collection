Printing things to the console is a very powerful tool in programming. Here's the basics of that in C using the `printf()` function.

In sample `$hello_world`, you are able to see the basics of printing. In this sample, you can see the basics of how to print numbers to the console.

## Tinker Ideas

- There's some extra space I left at line 45. Can you print out `I have 5 cookies for you!` using `printf` and `%i`?
- On one of the `printf`s, make it so the amount of `%i` and integers after the string are different. What happens?
- Try to print out `2.718` using `%i`. What happens?
  - Change the `%i` to a `%f`. What happens?
