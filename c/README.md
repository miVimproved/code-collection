# The C Programming Language

## About

C is a relatively low level compiled programming language. Allan please add details.

## Prereqs

- C compiler.
- Text editor.
- Debugger.

### Recommendations

- Linux.
  - GCC - A C compiler. It happens to be the one I use in all of my makefiles.
  - Visual Studio Code - A decent text editor... and also what I use to make all of these.
  - GDB - A command line debugger that is... amazing. Also Visual Studio Code can use it as well.
- Windows.
  - Visual Studio - An IDE (Integrated Development Enviornment). It includes a text editor, C/++ compiler, and also a debugger.
  - Or:
    - Visual Studio Code - Decent text editor, see Linux section.
    - MSVC or GCC - Two C compilers. Visual Studio comes with MSVC. I don't have much experience with using GCC on Windows.
    - TODO: Find a debugger to go here. I don't know any Windows ones.
